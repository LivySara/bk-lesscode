## App Template Usage Guide

The Blueking LessCode (LessCode) offers app-level templates such as official website templates, backend management templates, and announcement templates. These templates include complete app functionalities like functions, variables, and databases. You can directly create a new app based on these templates without assembling from scratch, and simply modify the corresponding content to quickly complete the app development.

There are two ways to use app templates:

### Create a New App Through the App Template Market

Go to Resource Market -> Template Market, select an appropriate app template, then click "Create as New App". Alternatively, you can download the app template source code and perform secondary development locally.
